# Intro
My first year teaching middle school programming was at a school in southwest  Florida. Before this, I had spent my entire life, personal and professional, in Ohio, a Midwesterner through and through. The head of the middle school was from Michigan, and she was also new to Florida. We would have many conversations about life back home. During a meeting one day, she said to me, "Blade, you have good ideas and know what you’re doing. You should write 'The Ohioan’s Guide to Teaching Programming'!" She would mention this almost every time she saw me, and that idea grew into this book.

## Who this book is for
This book is for the aspiring middle school programming teacher. Whether you are a veteran teacher who is diving into the programming world, a battle-hardened programmer taking your first steps into the halls of a middle school, or anywhere in between, this book is for you. This book is designed to give the reader ideas, tips, thought points, and guidance as he or she begins his or her journey. The field of computer science education is not a new one, but an ever-growing one in today's world, and needs good teachers to foster that growth.

## How to read this book
This book is meant as a guide and reference. You should read the book in its entirety before teaching your class. However, once you have read it and developed a big-picture idea of what I am talking about, pick it apart. Find the pieces that you want to apply to your class, adapt the ideas in this book to fit your situation, and take what works for you. There is never a one-size-fits-all in education, and I don’t plan on trying to make an attempt for that impossible goal.
