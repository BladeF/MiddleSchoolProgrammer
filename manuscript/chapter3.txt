# Chapter Three: Classroom Structure & Management
Be prepared for a hard workout in this chapter. We will now take a detailed look at classroom structure, both physical and otherwise, and how to manage the classroom. These can be difficult topics for any teacher, new or otherwise, to feel comfortable with. I encourage you to take your time here, truly think on these ideas, and come up with a plan beforehand. Even if you end up changing your plan, you need to have something lined up before going into the classroom. I often share this phrase with my students, and I find it applies well here: “You don’t need to have the direction, just a direction. Otherwise, you’re wandering aimlessly and won’t accomplish anything”

## Physical Structure
A lot can be said about the physical structure, arrangement, and orientation of your classroom. Ask one hundred teachers about their thoughts on this and you will probably get one hundred different answers. I will give you two potential configurations in my order of preference. However, you ultimately need to do what works best for your students. Try starting with one of these two configurations and, once you’ve gotten to know your students, modify as you see fit. A final disclaimer before continuing is that these are ideal configurations. You may not have enough space and/or equipment to make these happen, so you must make do with what you have available.

### Configuration One

![Configuration 1](images/conf1.png)

My ideal and favorite configuration is a horseshoe and center table. In the diagram above, the three rectangles represent individual desks for students to sit at. The chairs would be on the inside of the desks, allow you to see all screens from the front of the classroom. This allows you to monitor the work happening and potential distractions occurring.
You also have a table in the center of the room. I would always make my students leave their computers at the desks if it was a class that brought their own devices. The center table was the place to talk and collaborate. You could have a separate set of chairs for the big table, or, more frugally, use the same chairs from the outer desks.
This is the configuration I have used with great success. When I was giving notes and doing general teaching, I would have the students leave their computers at the desk and gather around the big table with notebooks. This eliminates the temptation of being on the computer as I am teaching and creates a mental distinction between the areas. The desks are where students would work on code and be on their computers, and I could monitor what was happening on the screens.

### Configuration Two

In this second configuration, you also separate the learning area from the working area. On the left, you see a series of rectangles that represent desks. This is where you can teach the students with a board and have them taking notes. I would encourage you to not allow computers in this area. To the right, you have circle tables that can help group work. These tables are where students can write code and collaborate with their peers. You can also have a better chance of catching any non-academic activity happening on screen at the circle tables over the desks.

When choosing a configuration of a coding classroom, there are two key ideas to keep in mind: computer monitoring and separation of learning and working areas. As long as you are able to monitor computers, see any erroneous activity, and keep the students in line you are at an advantage. To help facilitate this, creating separate areas for working and learning can help students to develop some self-monitoring. If they bring a computer into the learning area, they know that something is out of line and will be caught by you. Work with whatever space you are given and try to comply with these ideas, and you will be helping yourself down the road.

## Lesson Structure
Just as critical is the structure of your lessons. Have a good, consistent flow and structure gives the students a frame to work within. Now, there are going to be plenty of interruptions and exceptions to your framework. It’s best to know that upfront and be aware so you are not caught off guard. Things like fire drills, tornado drills, power outages, assemblies, and early dismissals are commonplace in the school environment. That being said, keeping a similar format to your lessons will help the students to develop a routine and foundation that they can build on. You can see a general outline below:

1. Plan for the day
2. Recall & Review
3. Meat
4. Recap
5. Q&A

### Plan for the Day
Let the students know what they will be doing that day. I remember a class where I was having difficulty in managing the students and keeping them focused. I had tried a few techniques to get things under control to no avail. I finally talked to the students, telling them what issues I was seeing and asking how I could help them. They all unanimously agreed that it was hard to know what I was expecting from them each day, and having me give them the plan and expectations would help them to keep focused. Sure enough, I started writing the daily objectives on the board and they started completing their work.

### Recall & Review
A key aspect of teaching is making sure the new information is properly connected to the old information. Take a few minutes at the start of each class to recall the relevant material from previous lessons and review it. Let’s say that you were teaching students conditions. In order to teach conditions, you also need the students to know Boolean values. Taking the time to review Booleans will allow students to make more and stronger connections between conditions and Booleans.
There is a way to utilize this time for a double purpose. Not only can you get the relevant information into the students’ minds, you can also get the students more connected to and invested in the class with one simple modification: a student teacher. Have a student lead the review time. What seems like such a simple idea can have a massive impact. It helps the students to feel more confident in the material, empathize with you, take better notes, to pay more attention to name a few impacts. A healthy mix of student volunteers and calling on students makes sure that all are ready to teach the material.

### Meat
Once the plan for the day is laid out and the relevant material freshly recalled, it’s time to get to the meat of the lesson. The next chapter will talk about teaching the meat of the course, so I won’t spend too much time talking about it here. Suffice it to say that teaching the meat of the day can come in many forms and will take up most of the class. My classes are usually between 45-50 minutes, depending on the school, and I calculate about 30-35 minutes of hardcore teaching each lesson.

### Recap
Make sure you take the time to recap your lesson at the end of the class. Put everything in its place, re-explain the major connecting points, and summarize each topic. Middle school students can get swept up in the details while teaching and miss the big picture. Make sure to address both the details and the broader scope of things in every lesson. This also serves as a time and place to make any final points. Recapping the day is an important part of the lesson, serving as a nice bundle of the critical points from the lesson. Make sure that you take the time to include this in your plan.

### Q&A
It is absolutely critical to allow the students time to ask questions every single class. Some students may ask questions as you are teaching, stopping you to get something clarified, while others may not. A more shy student might not want to stop you and wait until there is nothing else going on to ask his or her questions. A student may also not realize they have a question as they are learning, but, during the recap, will see something they would like to have explained. I try to give at least five minutes from every class up to Q&A time.

## Classroom Management
There is much to say about classroom management. First and foremost, if you fall under the new teacher category, I rather strongly suggest you take a course or professional development in classroom management. This is such a critical skill set that you don’t want to try and build it from scratch as you go. You can always improve, but you need a starting point before you begin teaching. Second, the following points are guidelines. You ultimately need to figure out what works for you, your teaching style, and your situation. Use this to begin, but tailor your approach as you go and note any significant discoveries in your journal. Observing other teachers, being observed, and finding a mentor teacher can provide you with a greater perspective and expose you to potential solutions as well.

### Democracy vs Dictatorship
As mentioned before, I believe it is critical to listen to your students. Make them feel included and important. Allow them to share their thoughts and feedback. Doing these things creates a sense of ownership and investment for the students. This isn’t just a programming class, this is their programming class! Have some democratic process that allows these attitudes and avenues to develop. However, you must keep in mind and be clear with the students that there are some things that simply are what they are. I like to call those “executive decisions” that go above them, so they don’t have a say.
This is as much a cultural phenomena as it is a procedural one. In order to create this democratic classroom, you must set up an environment where it can happen. Allow your students to be open without judgment, hear and listen, respond without condescending, and implement their appropriate ideas. Once you have this culture set up, the students will respond to the procedures. They have to know that it’s okay for them to share and take ownership of the class before they will.

### Handling Different Types of Students
There are many types of students that will come through your door. You will eventually start to see overall patterns, even if the details are different. Knowing how to handle and work with these types of students is an important skill in successful classroom management, and takes some work to get good at juggling all the types at once. Let’s take a look at some of the major types you are likely to see.

#### Always have a question
There are some students who will always have a question. You may not have even said a word yet and his or her hand is already waving in the air. These are generally eager students, often excited about the class and material. Make sure you attend to this joy but help them to know when it’s a good time to ask questions. I will often tell my students that I will not answer a question right now, but to write it down and I will let them know when it’s an okay time. This is usually a few minutes afterward, once I have finished my thought or covered the example. I will also gesture for them to put their hands down while I’m talking, which I train my students to understand this silent cue means to not interrupt what’s happening right now. Middle schoolers are still figuring out how the world works, so be patient and teach them timing.
Sometimes the motives are a little less pure. Students can, and will, ask you random questions to try and get you off topic. For these students, there are a few responses. The first one is to simply ignore the question. You can let them ask it and simply go right back to teaching or acknowledge it first and say that this is not an appropriate time. Second, you can give a two-word answer and move on. This is useful when the question is somewhat related, like when a student is asking about a homework from two days ago but you are teaching new material and went over it yesterday. Finally, sometimes you must simply give in. It’s hard to edify when those moments are, so I leave that side quest for you to complete.

#### Always have a comment
Some students will simply talk while you are teaching. He may narrate the work he is doing, make comments about what’s happening on the board, talk to his neighbor, or raise his hand to share a thought. These students can sometimes have good insight, but, like baked goods, the comments are only good in moderation. Some students thrive on attention and feel a need to make a comment on everything to get that attention. You must help them learn when and what comments are okay. Allow them to occasionally have their moments to share, as that is what they need, but curtail it when needed. My classes often have structured learning time and a freer working time. The working time is where I let these students shine. I will go around and listen to their thoughts, commenting on and acknowledging them.

#### Know-it-alls
Sometimes you will have a student in your class who has done some programming before, maybe even to a pretty intermediate level. She will ask questions and use as many buzz words as they can. Their reasoning can range anywhere from simple curiosity to trying to show off to the other students. If this behavior happens more than once in a while, I tend to take the student aside and have a heart-to-heart with her. I will tell her that I am so appreciative of her knowledge and that she is pursuing programming on her own time to such a high degree, but there is a time and place for super technical talks. I explain that it can make others feel embarrassed or down about their own skills, and I don’t want my other students to feel that way or for them to be mad at the person making them feel that way. If she is receptive to this, you may sometimes have to remind her about your agreement, but there is a general reduction in this behavior. You may also have to set aside time before and/or after class to indulge the technical conversations every once in a while.

#### Never-talkers
Some students are incredibly shy and soft-spoken. That is simply a fact of life. They will never talk nor raise their hand, so you must find a way to connect with them. I tell my students at the beginning of every semester/year that, at some point, they will be called on and they will be a student teacher. Some may go more than others, but everyone will go at least once. With that in mind, I always try to engage with him in some way. I will call on him to answer questions every few classes to get them engaging with the rest of the students, or talk to him in a more one-on-one manner during work time, or even something as simple as flashing him a thumbs-up to do a nonverbal check of how he is feeling about the material. Respecting the nature of those students while still fostering growth and community can make a world of difference, and all it requires is getting to know your students. Once you know them, you can find a way to connect with and include them in the class.

### Extraneous Activity
This final area to manage can be the most dangerous one in a programming classroom. Students will be at computers for most of, if not the entire, class time. If you are not carefully monitoring, they can and will wander. I have had students watching YouTube videos, playing games, IM’ing each other, looking at pictures, watching sports, and many more extraneous activities. They are middle schoolers, and computers are Cave of Wonders.
Having one of the seating configurations can help greatly with this. Arranging the students so it is very difficult to hide the monitor allows you to have easy viewing access to what’s going on. Another tactic that I readily employ is moving around the classroom as I teach. Unless I am actively writing on the board, I’m moving around. I keep it very natural looking, but I always have one eye turned towards the monitors. Sometimes, if the room is just right, you can even see reflections in things like windows. Work with whatever space you have to try and keep an eye on monitors at all times.
If you happen to catch a student wandering, there are one of two responses: internal or external handling. There are certain situations where you can handle things yourself. There are also certain situations where an administrator is the better choice. If you choose to handle things in-house, I recommend an escalating scale. First, I go to the student and tell her that I see she is wandering and to stop. If it continues, I will tell her to stop in front of the class. Should this wandering not cease, I move her to sit directly in front of me. Finally, the last step is to not allow her to work on a computer in class. She must do everything by hand and do the digital work on her own time. Make sure that the students know that doing anything outside of work is not allowed and will not be tolerated. Be a democracy, but one with a firm leader at the helm.

Classroom management is a fantastically large topic of which we have only scratched the surface. We could take a never-ending detour from our hike to follow this rabbit trail. While that may seem daunting, take heart. That means that no matter your situation, someone has probably suffered through it before and has wisdom for you. We will march on, but always keep this rabbit trail in mind as you going through the year. Talk to colleagues, read books and articles, go to professional developments, and experiment on your own. Find what works for you and your students and develop that culture.
